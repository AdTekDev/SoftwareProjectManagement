# 04.03.01

You are the production manager of Alpaca Cozy Socks, a company that produces socks using alpaca wool with funky designs. The current sewing machine used by the company is at the end of its life - You must thus select a new machine. There are several options available on the market, each of them resulting in cost savings given that they consume less electricity and/or require less maintenance than the current model used.  

Your managerial accounting analyst prepared the following analysis for each of the machines:  

Machine	A	B	C  
Cost and Installation ($)	40,000	50,000	80,000  
Useful life (years)	10	12	15  
Annual depreciation ($)	4,000	5,000	8,000  
Annual cash savings ($)	8,000	5,000	10,000
